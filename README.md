Overview
This project focuses on analyzing order cancellations on an e-commerce website, categorized into three key stages: M2S (Move to Ship), Pre-ship, and Post-manifest. The analysis aims to uncover the reasons behind cancellations at each stage, identify patterns, and provide insights to improve order fulfillment processes and customer satisfaction.

Objective
The primary objective is to reduce the overall order cancellation rate by understanding the specific issues at different stages of the order process. By breaking down the cancellations into M2S, Pre-ship, and Post-manifest stages, we can target specific operational inefficiencies and enhance the customer experience.

Key Stages
1.M2S (Move to Ship) Analysis

Definition: Orders that are in the process of being prepared for shipment.
Focus: Identify cancellations due to inventory discrepancies, packing issues, or initial fulfillment delays.
Common Reasons:
Inventory mismatch
Incorrect product details
Packing errors
Metrics:
M2S Cancellation Rate
Time to M2S
Inventory Accuracy

2.Pre-ship Analysis

Definition: Orders that are packed and ready but not yet shipped.
Focus: Analyze cancellations due to last-minute customer decisions, payment issues, or packing errors.
Common Reasons:
Customer change of mind
Payment failures
Discovery of product issues
Metrics:
Pre-ship Cancellation Rate
Time to Shipping
Payment Success Rate

3.Post-manifest Analysis

Definition: Orders that have been shipped but canceled before delivery is completed.
Focus: Examine cancellations related to shipping delays, tracking problems, or customer service issues.
Common Reasons:
Delivery delays
Incorrect shipping information
Dissatisfaction with customer service
Metrics:
Post-manifest Cancellation Rate
Delivery Time Variability
Customer Service Resolution Rate

Methodology
1.Data Collection
Gather order data, including timestamps, status changes, customer feedback, and logistics information.
Collect data from the order management system, customer service logs, and shipment tracking systems.

2.Data Analysis
Categorize data according to the three stages: M2S, Pre-ship, and Post-manifest.
Use statistical analysis to calculate cancellation rates, identify trends, and correlate cancellations with operational factors.
Visualize data using charts and graphs to identify patterns.

3.Recommendations
Develop targeted strategies to address identified issues at each stage.
Propose process improvements, such as better inventory management, streamlined packing, and enhanced shipping practices.
Suggest policy adjustments for customer interactions and communication.

3.Expected Outcomes
Reduced overall order cancellation rate.
Improved operational efficiency across different stages of order fulfillment.
Enhanced customer satisfaction through quicker resolution of order issues and more reliable delivery.

4.Tools and Technologies
Data Analysis: Python (pandas, NumPy), SQL
Visualization: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Sources: Order management system, Customer feedback forms, Shipment tracking databases



Monitor changes and measure impact on order cancellation rates.
